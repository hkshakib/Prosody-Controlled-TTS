# Prosody-Controlled-TTS (4th Year Thesis)

As part of my fourth-year thesis, I explored the challenges associated with
generating natural-sounding Bengali speech from text inputs, including issues
related to prosody and intonation.

I utilized cutting-edge VITS, Tecotron 2 and FASTPITCH models to develop a Bengali TTS system
that allowed for precise control of prosody and pitch variations in the generated speech.
